# Render Props Pattern

## What is it?
A reusable `Toggle` component that manages an internal state and exposes it using the Render Props pattern.

## Why do we need it?
It helps separate state logic from UI, allowing the same toggle behavior to be reused with different designs like buttons, switches, or icons.

## One-liner
Control the toggle logic once and customize the UI anywhere.
